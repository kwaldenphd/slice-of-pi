# Binary, Bits, and Basics

This module covers how information is represented in binary code. It covers calculating bytes using binary addition and reading a binary clock. The module also incorporates hand-on work with exploring how text and color are represented in binary, and using a hex editor to manipulate binary code. This module is designed to highlight and clarify the relationship between the logical, physical, and conceptual facets of digital objects.

Module type: Introductory

# Building a LAMP Stack

This module covers installation for the various components of a LAMP stack. Specifically, this module works at the command line to cover installing and configuring a firewall; automating Pi updates and upgrades; and installing and configuring Apache, MySQL, and PHP. The module also explains the functions of a web server in delivering content to the WWW. 

Module type: Intermediate/Advanced

# How Computers Work

This module covers a variety of topics related to how computers "work." It is designed to provide an understanding of how the basic logical and mathematical operations underlying computation are performed mechanically. It uses a simulation of CPU architecture to learn more about how an instruction is processed along the CPU data path cycle and how values from memory are incorporated into CPU instructions. Finally, it covers reading and writing basic machine language, to see the 0s and 1s underneath higher level programming and apply them to basic algorithms.

Module type: Introductory

# HTML and CSS

This module covers the basic syntax for HTML and CSS. It incorporates installing software at the command line and working in an integrated development environment (IDE). The module provides guidance for using the Geany IDE to generate HTML pages and CSS stylesheets for HTML pages. The module ends with an independent website project.

Module type: Introductory

# Image Representation

This module covers the difference between image file formats (GIF and JPEG). It uses the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) to re-size image files, and explore the effects of image compression. 

Module type: Introductory

# Python

This module covers a variety of introductory concepts in Python. The module outlines the differences between high-level programming languages and machine language, and uses Geany to write and execute Python programs. It covers using Python methods and functions to work with strings and numbers, assign variables, concatenate strings, create lists, and define dictionaries. It also includes a section on using Python to parse XML.

Module type: Introductory

# Searching Functions in Python

This module uses Python to provide a hands-on overview of different types of searching functions and techniques, as well as an introduction to different kinds of sorting algorithms. This module also covers Boolean operators that can be useful in searching a range of database and search engine systems.

Module type: Intermediate/Advanced
