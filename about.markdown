*A Slice of Pi* is an open-source resource for using the Raspberry Pi in the LIS and DH classroom. It includes series of lessons, modules, and tutorials that use the Raspberry Pi to cover aspects of computing fundamentals, markup languages, programming with Python, building a LAMP stack, and installing open-source software.

Some of these curriculum materials were created by Dr. Mattock for use in the [University of Iowa School of Library and Information Science's SLIS 5020 "Computing Foundations" course](http://lindsaymattock.net/computingfoundations.html). Modules originally developed by Dr. Mattock and adapted by Dr. Walden include:
- Binary, Bits, and Basics
- Introduction to Raspberry Pi
- HTML/CSS
- XML/XSLT
- Python
- Building a LAMP stack
- Installing WordPress

Other curriculum materials includes modules developed and by Dr. Walden for use in the Grinnell College Department of Computer Science course [CSC 105, "The Digital Age,"](http://digitalage20.sites.grinnell.edu/) which she taught in Spring 2020. Those modules include:
- Searching Functions in Python
- How Computers Work
- Image Representation
- Introduction to Algorithms

Dr. Walden's CSC 105 "The Digital Age" curriculum offers a sample syllabus that incorporates all modules on this site in sequence. Dr. Mattock's SLIS 5020 "Computing Foundations" curriculum offers a graduate-level sample syllabus that historically has only incorporated the modules developed by Dr. Mattock.

The "Bibliography" page on this site includes both theoretical and applied readings from critical DH and LIS literature that supplement the concepts covered in the tutorials.
